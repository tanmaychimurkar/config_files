# dotfiles
This repository contains the common configuration files that I use for setting up my workflow. 

Much of the configs are set up for a Linux-based workstation, and the dotfiles are not yet professional as I have seen them in other repositories online. However, the `setup_dotfiles.sh` script should do the job in setting up your machine as
per the specifications in the dotfiles. As always, recommendations/corrections are always welcome :)
